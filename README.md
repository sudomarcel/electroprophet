## Version 0

The goal of the version is to developp a model to :

- Predict the electricity production hourly from wind turbine and photovoltaic for day+1,
- Study the carbon footprint of electricity production,
- Advice people when electricity is at low carbon to connect electric device (washing machine, electric car...) and advice people when electricity production is at high carbon footprint to suggest to disconnect electric devices.
